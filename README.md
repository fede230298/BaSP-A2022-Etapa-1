### Week 0

In this week of development we designed the view of the pages and its flows in Figma, giving the pages the necessary interactions to make it work and give it a full display of what it can do.

### Week 1

In this week we started the development of the webpage of *Trackgenix*. We created the HTML file with the landing page following the Figma style. This does not include CSS or JS. We used Git to manage our version of the project. We created the GitHub repository and pushed the changes.

In this week we started implementing CSS to the landing page that was made the previous week. Tried to picture it pixel perfect by adding styles to the HTML. Didn't implement neither Flex nor Grid to this week's project.

Deployed the repository in GitHub Pages. It can be opened by clicking the titles. Each Title redirect you to each week's progress.

### Week 5

In this week we implemented two new html, one a sign up and the other a login form. Both with its inputs validated through Javascript. The main focus this week was to deeper understand and implement Javascript logic and manipulate the DOM.

### Week 6

In this week we implemented two new functionalities. Both require to fetch a url and send it with params through a GET request. One is for the login page, to see if the attempt to login is successful or not. The other is for the signup page, to see if the data sent match all the requirements necessary to create an account. Whatsmore, here if the "creation" is successful, the page sent us back a response with the data sent. That data is stored in the web localstorage to be later used if the webpage is refreshed and autocomplete all the fields.
